## Contributions
The code was written primarily on Booker and Andrewâ€™s computers. The full team met about twice a week on Wednesdays and Sundays to code the basics and debug any issues that had come up. These meetings were held in Zoom, where Booker or Andrew shared their screens so everyone could view and contribute. 
In between meetings, Booker and Andrew made improvements to the code, while Taylor and Kaitlyn handled documentation. Kaitlyn also provided the artwork for the logo.
